Upon start of the program, take the current keyboard layout
to be our main keyboard layout.

Upon keyboard layout change event:
{
    if our keyboard layout is something other than the main layout,
    record the current layout and the current window and
    associate the layout with the window.

    if our keyboard layout is main, remove the record of
    the current window if it exists.
}

Upon window change event:
{
    if the window is in the records,
    change the layout to what is in the records.

    if it's not, change the layout to the default one.
}
