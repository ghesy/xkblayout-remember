complete the Record data structure
{
    maybe we have to have a way to overwrite old window data
    if window numbers exceed the size of the r[] array

    finish record() and free()
    however, it could be more efficient to not have a free(),
    because then for windows that should have the defaylt kblayout,
    we won't have to search the entire fucking array only to find out
    this window should be on the default layout.

    Pros of having free():
        Now we ONLY have to keep windows whose kblayout we want changed
    Cons of having free():
        Search of almost every window will now bottom out

    ok u know wat? ghash it is.
    I have to use g_direct_hash() for my usecase.
}
